<p>A number of health issues are common around the globe. Disease is one of the most common. According to GlobalIssues.org, approximately 36 million people die each year from non-communicable (i.e., not contagious) diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung disease.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-:1-29">[29]</a></sup></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among communicable diseases, both viral and bacterial, AIDS/HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria are the most common, causing millions of deaths every year.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-:1-29">[29]</a></sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another health issue that causes death or contributes to other health problems is malnutrition, especially among children. One of the groups malnutrition affects most is young children. Approximately 7.5 million children under the age of 5 die from malnutrition, usually brought on by not having the money to find or make food.<sup>[29]</sup></p>

<p>Bodily injuries are also a common health issue worldwide. These injuries, including bone fractures and burns, can reduce a person's quality of life or can cause fatalities including infections that resulted from the injury (or the severity injury in general).<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoffett2013-30">[30]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-:1-29">[29]</a></sup></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lifestyle choices are contributing factors to poor health in many cases. These include smoking cigarettes, and can also include a poor diet, whether it is overeating or an overly constrictive diet. Inactivity can also contribute to health issues and also a lack of sleep, excessive alcohol consumption, and neglect of oral hygiene.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoffett2013-30">[30]</a></sup>&nbsp;There are also genetic disorders that are inherited by the person and can vary in how much they affect the person (and when they surface).<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoffett2013-30">[30]</a></sup></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the majority of these health issues are preventable, a major contributor to global ill health is the fact that approximately 1 billion people lack access to health care systems.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-:1-29">[29]</a></sup>&nbsp;Arguably, the most common and harmful health issue is that a great many people do not have access to quality remedies.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup></p>

<p>The World Health Organization describes mental health as "a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community".<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> Mental health is not just the absence of mental illness.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-Bos-34">[34]</a></sup></p>

<p>Mental illness is described as 'the spectrum of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral conditions that interfere with social and emotional well-being and the lives and productivity of people.
