<p>An important way to maintain one's personal health is to have a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods that provide nutrients to the body. Such nutrients provide the body with energy and keep it running. Nutrients help build and strengthen bones, muscles, and tendons and also regulate body processes (i.e., blood pressure). Water is essential for growth, reproduction and good health. Macronutrients are consumed in relatively large quantities and include proteins, carbohydrates, and fats and fatty acids. Micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – are consumed in relatively smaller quantities, but are essential to body processes.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> The food guide pyramid is a pyramid-shaped guide of healthy foods divided into sections. Each section shows the recommended intake for each food group (i.e., protein, fat, carbohydrates and sugars). Making healthy food choices can lower one's risk of heart disease and the risk of developing some types of cancer, and can help one maintain their weight within a healthy range.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Mediterranean diet is commonly associated with health-promoting effects. This is sometimes attributed to the inclusion of bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds, isoprenoids and alkaloids.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup></p>

<p>Physical exercise enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. It strengthens one's bones and muscles and improves the cardiovascular system. According to the National Institutes of Health, there are four types of exercise: enduranc<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance">e</a>, strength, flexibility, and balance.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> The CDC states that physical exercise can reduce the risks of heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, depression, and anxiety.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> For the purpose of counteracting possible risks, it is often recommended to start physical exercise gradually as one goes. Participating in any exercising, whether it is housework, yardwork, walking or standing up when talking on the phone, is often thought to be better than none when it comes to health.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup></p>

<p>Sleep is an essential component to maintaining health. In children, sleep is also vital for growth and development. Ongoing sleep deprivation has been linked to an increased risk for some chronic health problems. In addition, sleep deprivation has been shown to correlate with both increased susceptibility to illness and slower recovery times from illness.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> In one study, people with chronic insufficient sleep, set as six hours of sleep a night or less, were found to be four times more likely to catch a cold compared to those who reported sleeping for seven hours or more a night.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> Due to the role of sleep in regulating metabolism, insufficient sleep may also play a role in weight gain or, conversely, in impeding weight loss.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> Additionally, in 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is the cancer research agency for the World Health Organization, declared that "shiftwork that involves circadian disruption is probably carcinogenic to humans," speaking to the dangers of long-term nighttime work due to its intrusion on sleep.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> In 2015, the National Sleep Foundation released updated recommendations for sleep duration requirements based on age, and concluded that "Individuals who habitually sleep outside the normal range may be exhibiting signs or symptoms of serious health problems or, if done volitionally, may be compromising their health and well-being."<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup></p>
