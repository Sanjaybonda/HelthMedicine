<p>Contemporary medicine is in general conducted within health care systems. Legal, credentialing and financing frameworks are established by individual governments, augmented on occasion by international organizations, such as churches. The characteristics of any given health care system have significant impact on the way medical care is provided.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From ancient times, Christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals and the Catholic Church today remains the largest non-government provider of medical services in the world.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> Advanced industrial countries (with the exception of the United States)<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-IOM-53">[53]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-ccuhc-54">[54]</a></sup> and many developing countries provide medical services through a system of universal health care that aims to guarantee care for all through a single-payer health care system, or compulsory private or co-operative health insurance. This is intended to ensure that the entire population has access to medical care on the basis of need rather than ability to pay. Delivery may be via private medical practices or by state-owned hospitals and clinics, or by charities, most commonly by a combination of all three.</p>

<p>Most tribal societies provide no guarantee of healthcare for the population as a whole. In such societies, healthcare is available to those that can afford to pay for it or have self-insured it (either directly or as part of an employment contract) or who may be covered by care financed by the government or tribe directly.</p>

<p>Transparency of information is another factor defining a delivery system. Access to information on conditions, treatments, quality, and pricing greatly affects the choice by patients/consumers and, therefore, the incentives of medical professionals. While the US healthcare system has come under fire for lack of openness,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup>&nbsp;new legislation may encourage greater openness. There is a perceived tension between the need for transparency on the one hand and such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation of information for commercial gain on the other.</p>

<p>Primary care medical services are provided by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or other health professionals who have first contact with a patient seeking medical treatment or care.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> These occur in physician offices, clinics, nursing homes, schools, home visits, and other places close to patients. About 90% of medical visits can be treated by the primary care provider. These include treatment of acute and chronic illnesses, preventive care and health education for all ages and both sexes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Secondary care medical services are provided by medical specialists in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals for a patient referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> Referrals are made for those patients who required the expertise or procedures performed by specialists. These include both ambulatory care and inpatient services, Emergency departments, intensive care medicine, surgery services, physical therapy, labor and delivery, endoscopy units, diagnostic laboratory and medical imaging services, hospice centers, etc. Some primary care providers may also take care of hospitalized patients and deliver babies in a secondary care setting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tertiary care medical services are provided by specialist hospitals or regional centers equipped with diagnostic and treatment facilities not generally available at local hospitals. These include trauma centers, burn treatment centers, advanced neonatology unit services, organ transplants, high-risk pregnancy, radiation oncology, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Modern medical care also depends on information – still delivered in many health care settings on paper records, but increasingly nowadays by electronic means.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In low-income countries, modern healthcare is often too expensive for the average person. International healthcare policy researchers have advocated that "user fees" be removed in these areas to ensure access, although even after removal, significant costs and barriers remain.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup></p>

<p>Separation of prescribing and dispensing is a practice in medicine and pharmacy in which the physician who provides a medical prescription is independent from the pharmacist who provides the prescription drug. In the Western world there are centuries of tradition for separating pharmacists from physicians. In Asian countries, it is traditional for physicians to also provide drugs.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup></p>

<p>Postage stamp, New Zealand, 1933. Public health has been promoted – and depicted – in a wide variety of ways.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Public health has been described as "the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals."<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup> It is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on population health analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a pandemic). Public health has many sub-fields, but typically includes the interdisciplinary categories of epidemiology, biostatistics and health services. Environmental health, community health, behavioral health, and occupational health are also important areas of public health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The focus of public health interventions is to prevent and manage diseases, injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the promotion of healthy behavior, communities, and (in aspects relevant to human health) environments. Its aim is to prevent health problems from happening or re-occurring by implementing educational programs, developing policies, administering services and conducting research.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup> In many cases, treating a disease or controlling a pathogen can be vital to preventing it in others, such as during an outbreak. Vaccination programs and distribution of condoms to prevent the spread of communicable diseases are examples of common preventive public health measures, as are educational campaigns to promote vaccination and the use of condoms (including overcoming resistance to such).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Public health also takes various actions to limit the health disparities between different areas of the country and, in some cases, the continent or world. One issue is the access of individuals and communities to health care in terms of financial, geographical or socio-cultural constraints.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> Applications of the public health system include the areas of maternal and child health, health services administration, emergency response, and prevention and control of infectious and chronic diseases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The great positive impact of public health programs is widely acknowledged. Due in part to the policies and actions developed through public health, the 20th century registered a decrease in the mortality rates for infants and children and a continual increase in life expectancy in most parts of the world. For example, it is estimated that life expectancy has increased for Americans by thirty years since 1900,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> and worldwide by six years since 1990.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup></p>
